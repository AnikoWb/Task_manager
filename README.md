# Task_manager
This is one of the Capstone projects I created during the Software Engineering Course at HyperionDev.

This project was built to provide a task database and task manager for teams. The admin user has higher privileges and permissions, they can register new users, run reports and statistics including the number of users, number of tasks, and task-related data (eg. the total number and percentage of completed, incomplete and overdue tasks, and the same data aligned to each user). All the users have the following options in the program: add new tasks, view and update the tasks assigned to them. The program reads and rewrites updated information from and to a text file. This program can be extremely useful for remote working teams.
